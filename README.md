C-TURTL
=======

Move the turtle by writing instructions into its DNA.

- **F**: move the turtle **forward**
- **L**: rotate the turtle 45° **left** (counter-clockwise)
- **R**: rotate the turtle 45° **right** (clockwise)
- **B**: make a **baby** turtle
- **P**: **poop**
- **C**: **clean** up the poop

The turtle dies at the end of the DNA.  Baby turtles start over at the beginning
of the DNA.

I'm not much of an artist, so the turtle looks like this: ■

Inspired by Isabel Beach's [L-systems and Turtle Graphics][1] and Susam Pal's
[CFRS\[\]][2].

Enjoy!
